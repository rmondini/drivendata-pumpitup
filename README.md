# Pump It Up - Data Mining the Water Table

I participated in the 'Pump It Up - Data Mining the Water Table' challenge by DrivenData to predict functional water pumps in Tanzania using a dataset of approximately 60,000 observations collected by the Tanzanian Ministry of Water. More details on the challenge can be found at

My code can be found in the Jupyter notebook called "main.ipynb".
